Manual Configuration of the DocFlow

It is often possible to install the uupx DocFlow even when the automatic configuration fails by performing the configuration steps manually.

1. Install the files
Extract DocFlow.zip to a directory on your local hard drive

2. Create an IIS Vroot for the DocFlow
Use the Internet Services Manager (inetmgr) to create a virtual root to the application's subdirectory ¡°WEB¡± below the installation directory. 

3. Install the Database in Local SQL server
Use the DocFlow.sql script from the ¡°DbScripts¡± installation directory  to create the SQL database. 

4. Create Indexing Service catalog ¡°DocFlow_INDEXINGSRV¡±

5. Add ¡°Data\Files¡± directory to this catalog

6. Edit the Connection String in Web.Config
Edit the ConnectionString value in the web.config file to add a valid OLE DB connection string to your database server. The name of the DocFlow database is "DocFlow".

For example: 

     <add key="ConnectionString" value="Provider=SQLOLEDB;server=localhost;database=DocFlow;User Id=sa;pwd=" />

7. Set the ¡°IndexingServiceStorageDir¡± and ¡°OriginalStorageDir¡± values in the web.config file to absolute paths of the ¡°Data\Files¡± and ¡°Data\OriginalFiles¡± directories below the installation directory.


If you configured the sample, you can now browse the DocFlow web on this machine at
